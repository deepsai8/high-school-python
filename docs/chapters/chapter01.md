# Chapter 1: Introduction to Python

## What is Python?

### History and Origin
Python is a popular programming language created by **Guido van Rossum** and released in **1991**. But here’s the cool part—Python was named after *Monty Python’s Flying Circus*, a comedy show that Guido loved. So, Python isn't just serious business—it’s fun from the very start!

### Why Python?
Python is known for being **easy to read and write**, almost like writing in English! This is why it’s widely used in schools, universities, and even by companies like Google and NASA. You can use Python to make games, analyze data, or even control robots!

## Setting Up Python

Before we dive in, let’s get Python running on your computer. There are a few ways to do this:

### Installing Python
You can download and install Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Once installed, you can write and run Python code on your computer.

### Using Google Colab (No Installation Required!)
If you don’t want to install anything, use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). It’s like a Python playground in your browser! This is a great way to get started quickly.

### Python IDEs (Integrated Development Environments)
- **VS Code**: A lightweight editor with tons of features.
- **PyCharm**: A powerful IDE made specifically for Python.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: A great tool for writing Python alongside explanations (perfect for data science).

## Your First Python Program

Let’s write your first piece of Python code! We’ll keep it classic with a simple **"Hello, World!"** program.

### Code Example: "Hello, World!"

```python
# This is a comment! Python will ignore it
print("Hello, World!")
```

### Explanation:
- **`print()`** is a function that tells Python to display something on the screen. In this case, it will display “Hello, World!”.

## Fun Example: Greet the User

Let’s make this more personal! Write a program that asks the user for their name and greets them. Try this:

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")  # Takes input from the user
print("Hello, " + name + "! Welcome to Python!")  # Greets the user
```

### What’s Happening Here?
- **`input()`** lets the user type something.
- **`+`** combines (concatenates) strings together.

Now, when you run this, it will ask for your name and greet you personally. Cool, right?

## Mini Project: Build a Simple Calculator

Let’s take what you’ve learned and make a mini project—a calculator! It will ask for two numbers and an operation (like +, -, *, /), then give the result.

### Code Example: Simple Calculator

```python
# Ask the user for two numbers
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

# Ask for an operation
operation = input("Choose operation (+, -, *, /): ")

# Perform the operation
if operation == '+':
    result = num1 + num2
elif operation == '-':
    result = num1 - num2
elif operation == '*':
    result = num1 * num2
elif operation == '/':
    result = num1 / num2
else:
    result = "Invalid operation!"

print("The result is: " + str(result))
```

### Explanation:
- We use **`input()`** to take numbers and an operation from the user.
- **If statements** decide which operation to perform.
- We print the result!
