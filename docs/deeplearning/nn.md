# Neural Networks

## Why
Hand engineered features are time consuming, brittle and are not scalable.
Can we learn underlying features directly from the data that we have?

## Why Now?
### We now have all these:
* Big Data
* GPU
* Software (pytorch, keras, tf)
* Progression:
    - 1952: SGD
    - 1995: CNN
