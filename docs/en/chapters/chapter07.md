# Chapter 7: Wrapping Up and Final Project

You’ve made it! :tada: In this final chapter, we’ll review the key concepts you’ve learned, and then it’s time for you to apply those skills by building your very own Python projects. Don’t worry, I’ll provide some ideas to help you get started!

---

## Review of Key Concepts

Before we jump into the projects, let’s quickly recap what we’ve learned so far:

### 1. Python Basics
- **Printing**: Using `print()` to display text.
- **Variables**: Storing data like numbers, strings, and booleans.
- **Data Structures**: Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets to store and manage data.

### 2. Conditions and Control Flow
- **if-else statements**: Making decisions based on conditions.
- **Loops**: Repeating tasks with `for` and `while` loops.

### 3. Functions and Functional Programming
- **Defining functions**: Writing reusable blocks of code with `def`.
- **Lambda functions**: Writing mini-functions on the go.
- **Map, Filter, Reduce**: Applying functions to lists of data.

### 4. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Classes and objects**: Modeling real-world things using Python.
- **Methods and attributes**: Functions and data inside objects.
- **Inheritance**: Creating specialized classes that build on others.

### 5. Real-World Python Applications
- **Data Science**: Using Pandas and Matplotlib for analyzing and visualizing data.
- **Automation**: Automating tasks with libraries like Selenium.
- **AI and Machine Learning**: Using Scikit-learn to build simple AI models.

## Final Project Ideas

Now that you’ve reviewed the key concepts, it’s time to start building something fun and useful! Here are some project ideas to get your creativity flowing.

---

### Project Idea 1: Personal Assistant Program

Build a Python program that acts as your **personal assistant**. It could help you with daily tasks like setting reminders, looking up information, or even telling jokes!

**Suggested Features**:
- A menu that allows you to choose different actions.
- Set reminders for events (e.g., using a text file to store them).
- Look up the weather (you can use the OpenWeatherMap API).
- Tell a random joke or give a motivational quote.

### Code Starter:

```python
import time

def set_reminder(reminder, minutes):
    print(f"Reminder set: {reminder} in {minutes} minutes.")
    time.sleep(minutes * 60)
    print(f"Reminder: {reminder}")

def tell_joke():
    jokes = ["Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side!",
             "Why don't skeletons fight each other? They don't have the guts!"]
    print(random.choice(jokes))

# Add more features, like checking the time or setting multiple reminders.
```

### Project Idea 2: Simple Game (Tic-Tac-Toe)

Create a Python version of the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game. Two players can take turns marking the board, and the program will declare the winner.

**Suggested Features**:
- A 3x3 grid that shows the game board.
- Allow players to enter their moves and update the board.
- Detect when a player wins or if the game is a draw.

### Code Starter:

```python
def print_board(board):
    for row in board:
        print(" | ".join(row))

def check_winner(board):
    # Check rows, columns, and diagonals for a winner
    pass

board = [[" " for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]

# Let players input moves and display the updated board
print_board(board)
```

### Project Idea 3: Expense Tracker

Create an **expense tracker** that helps you manage your finances. You can log your expenses and income, categorize them, and calculate totals.

**Suggested Features**:
- Add, view, and delete expenses.
- Calculate total expenses and total income.
- Categorize expenses (e.g., food, entertainment, etc.).

### Code Starter:

```python
expenses = []

def add_expense(description, amount):
    expenses.append({"description": description, "amount": amount})
    print(f"Added: {description} - ${amount}")

def view_expenses():
    for expense in expenses:
        print(f"{expense['description']}: ${expense['amount']}")

# Add income, categorize expenses, and calculate totals
```

---

### Project Idea 4: Weather App

Create a Python program that fetches the current weather for any city using the **OpenWeatherMap API**.

**Suggested Features**:
- Ask the user to input a city.
- Fetch the weather data using the API.
- Display the current temperature, humidity, and weather condition.

### Code Starter:

```python
import requests

def get_weather(city):
    api_key = "your_api_key"
    url = f"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid={api_key}&units=metric"
    response = requests.get(url)
    data = response.json()

    if data["cod"] != "404":
        main = data["main"]
        weather = data["weather"][0]
        print(f"City: {city}")
        print(f"Temperature: {main['temp']}°C")
        print(f"Humidity: {main['humidity']}%")
        print(f"Weather: {weather['description']}")
    else:
        print("City not found!")

# Test the function with a city
get_weather("New York")
```

### Project Idea 5: Flashcard Quiz Game

Build a **flashcard quiz game** where you can study topics like vocabulary or historical facts. You can load questions from a file, ask the user for answers, and keep track of their score.

**Suggested Features**:
- Load flashcards (questions and answers) from a file.
- Ask questions and get user input.
- Keep track of the score and display results.

### Code Starter:

```python
flashcards = {"What is the capital of France?": "Paris",
              "What is 2 + 2?": "4",
              "Who wrote '1984'?": "George Orwell"}

def quiz(flashcards):
    score = 0
    for question, answer in flashcards.items():
        user_answer = input(question + " ")
        if user_answer.lower() == answer.lower():
            print("Correct!")
            score += 1
        else:
            print(f"Wrong! The answer is {answer}")

    print(f"Your score: {score}/{len(flashcards)}")

# Start the quiz
quiz(flashcards)
```
